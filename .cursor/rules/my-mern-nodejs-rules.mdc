- Always follow the established project structure and maintain consistent file organization.
- Aways industry best practices, SOLID principles, and framework-specific conventions.
- Implement appropriate design patterns that solve actual problems, avoid overengineering.
- Always Write clean, readable code - prioritize clarity over cleverness with meaningful names.
- Eliminate boilerplate code and unnecessary repetition.
- Reuse existing code and components - always check for existing implementations before creating new ones.
- Extend rather than duplicate - modify existing components/functions instead of copying.
- Create reusable abstractions by extracting common logic into utilities, hooks, or services.
- Maintain single source of truth - centralize configurations, constants, and shared logic.
- Write minimal, purposeful comments that focus on why not what.
- Create self-documenting code through clear naming and structure.
- Document complex business logic and non-obvious decisions only when necessary.
- Avoid premature optimization - profile first, then optimize bottlenecks.
- Implement proper error handling at appropriate levels.
- Alway Validate and sanitize inputs at system boundaries.
- Consider Docker for deployment.
- Use Git for version control.
- Use Node.js with Express.js for the backend.
- Use React.js with tailwindcss for the frontend
